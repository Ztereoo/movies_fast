This is a FastApi test project.
API gives movies rating and comments,
with users authorisation and authentication.

While working on a project it was the idea to work and practice with several 
libraries and tools such as:
-fastapi async functions
-custom authentication based on JWT
-pydantic models
-alembic versions
-async sqlite
-testing with Pytest
-caching with Redis
-tasks creating and visualisation with Celery and Flower
-web admin creating with SQLadmin
-Docker and docker compose containerization
-Github working
